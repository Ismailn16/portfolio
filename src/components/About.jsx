                                Hi, I'm Abdul Noor (also known as Ismail), a Software Engineering graduate from UWE Bristol with a passion for fintech and building B2C solutions that solve real-world problems. My academic journey culminated in a dissertation exploring the intersection of blockchain technology and modern online banking, which sparked my fascination with innovative finance solutions.
Currently working in telecommunications sales, I love all things tech and am particularly drawn to applying emerging technologies like machine learning to improve predictive accuracy and decision-making within the financial sector. What drives me is building technology that genuinely helps and aids people, creating meaningful solutions that make complex systems more accessible and user-friendly.
I'm enthusiastic about connecting with like-minded individuals who share a passion for fintech innovation and technology. Let's collaborate to drive the future of tech together! ðŸš€
